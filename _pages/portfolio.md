- **Dual-arm Manipulator for Surgical Incision**  
   *MuJoCo, OpenAI Gym, SOFA*  
   - Currently working on implementing a dual-arm manipulator for surgical incision, as a part of our final year
capstone project. 
   - Employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to achieve desired functionality.

- **Voice Controlled Manipulator**  
   *OpenCV, ROS*  
   - Developed an integrated voice and vision system for a manipulator, enabling voice-controlled operation and object
identification via computer vision.

- **Detection of Microplastics in Ocean Water Samples using Blob Detection and comparison of various Filtering Methods (DoG, LoG, DoH)**  
   *OpenCV, MATLAB*  
   - Implemented blob detection to detect and count microplastics in ocean water samples using thresholding,
morphology and filtering methods such as Difference of Gaussian, Laplacian of Gaussian and Difference of Hessian.
   - Compared the results of each method successfully and concluded the best methods considering several key
parameters such as size of microplastic, morphological method, kernel sizes of filters, kernel sizes of morphological
structuring elements, and threshold values.

- **Heart Rate Detection using Smartphone Camera**  
   *OpenCV, Mediapipe*  
   - Poly Plethysmographic (PPG) signal is extracted from the video recorded using a smartphone camera which is used
to detect volumetric changes in blood in the peripheral region.

- **Pose Estimation using various Low Light Image Enhancement Techniques**  
   *OpenCV*  
   - Developed a project focused on enhancing pose estimation accuracy in low-light conditions through the
implementation of advanced image enhancement techniques.
   - Compared six different low-light image enhancement algorithms.

- **Alzheimerâ€™s Detection**  
   *scikit-learn*  
   - Using Support Vector Machines (SVM) based on various cognitive parameters using OASIS dataset.
